Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

I'll edit sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py to treat non-http(s) URIs as paths: resolve them relative to source files and verify target exists and anchors if any. I'll open the file in an editor and implement a simple check replacing the 'local' return with logic to locate file and check anchors. Use sed to insert a basic implementation. I'll create a backup and apply a Python patch using awk to replace the check() function's local handling. \n\n```bash\nsed -n '1,240p' sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py > /tmp/linkcheck.py && python3 - <<'PY'\nfrom pathlib import Path\ns = Path('/tmp/linkcheck.py').read_text()\nold = \"            elif not uri.startswith(('http:', 'https:')):\\n                return 'local', '', 0\\n\"\nif old in s:\n    new = \"\"\"            elif not uri.startswith(('http:', 'https:')):\n                # treat as local/internal link: check that the target exists in source or output\n                # split off anchor if present\n                target = uri\n                anchor = None\n                if '#' in uri:\n                    target, anchor = uri.split('#', 1)\n                # consider relative paths and doc targets\n                # try source directory and output dir\n                srcdir = self.app.srcdir\n                outdir = self.outdir\n                candidates = []\n                if target.startswith('/'):\n                    candidates.append(path.join(srcdir, target.lstrip('/')))\n                    candidates.append(path.join(outdir, target.lstrip('/')))\n                else:\n                    candidates.append(path.join(srcdir, target))\n                    candidates.append(path.join(outdir, target))\n                found = False\n                for cand in candidates:\n                    # check file existence, allow rst/html extensions\n                    if path.exists(cand):\n                        found = True\n                        break\n                    for ext in ('.html', '.htm', '.rst'):\n                        if path.exists(cand + ext):\n                            found = True\n                            break\n                    if found:\n                        break\n                if not found:\n                    return 'broken', \\\"local target not found\\\", 0\n                # if anchor present and anchors checking enabled, try to find it in HTML\n                if anchor and self.app.config.linkcheck_anchors:\n                    # attempt to open the HTML file and search for anchor id/name\n                    try:\n                        # prefer HTML in outdir\n                        html_path = None\n                        for cand in candidates:\n                            p = cand\n                            if not path.exists(p) and path.exists(p + '.html'):\n                                p = p + '.html'\n                            if path.exists(p):\n                                html_path = p\n                                break\n                        if html_path:\n                            with open(html_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8', errors='ignore') as f:\n                                content = f.read()\n                            if ('id=\\\"%s\\\"' % anchor) in content or ('name=\\\"%s\\\"' % anchor) in content:\n                                return 'working', '', 0\n                            else:\n                                return 'broken', \\\"Anchor '%s' not found\\\" % anchor, 0\n                        else:\n                            return 'working', '', 0\n                    except Exception as err:\n                        return 'broken', str(err), 0\n                return 'working', '', 0\n\"\"\"\n    s = s.replace(old, new)\n    Path('sphinx/builders/linkcheck.py').write_text(s)\n    print('patched')\nelse:\n    print('pattern not found')\nPYTHONEXIT=$? && (test $PYTHONEXIT -eq 0) || exit $PYTHONEXIT\n```",
