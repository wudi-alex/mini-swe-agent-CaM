                "content": "THOUGHT: I\u2019ve identified that the issue occurs because collect_pages in sphinx/ext/viewcode.py doesn\u2019t check viewcode_enable_epub, so when building both html and epub together, module pages are still generated for epub. doctree_read already has the guard, so I added a similar early return in collect_pages to skip page generation for epub builders when viewcode_enable_epub is False. I\u2019ll now search for relevant tests or references to confirm the intended behavior and potentially run targeted tests next.\n\n```bash\ngrep -Rns \"viewcode_enable_epub\\|collect_pages\\|viewcode\" tests sphinx | sed -n '1,120p'\n```",
