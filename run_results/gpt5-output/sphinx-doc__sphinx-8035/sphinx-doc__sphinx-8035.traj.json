                "content": "THOUGHT: I\u2019ve implemented support for specific private members in autodoc by:\n- Changing :private-members: from a boolean to accept a list via members_option for both ModuleDocumenter and ClassDocumenter.\n- Adding merge_private_members_option to merge specified private member names into :members: when a list is provided.\n- Adjusting filter_members so that when :private-members: is a list, only those specified private members are included; when flag form (ALL), existing behavior remains.\nFocused tests for private-members pass. I will now submit the changes.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
