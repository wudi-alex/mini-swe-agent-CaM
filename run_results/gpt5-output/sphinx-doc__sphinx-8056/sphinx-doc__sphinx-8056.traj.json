Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

                "content": "THOUGHT: We need to modify napoleon's parameter parsing to preserve formatting when multiple parameter names are combined on one line, as with \"x1, x2 : array_like, optional\". The method to adjust is _parse_parameters_section in sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py. We'll update it so that when a field's name contains a comma (indicating multiple names), it falls back to grouped field-list formatting instead of emitting separate :param/:type lines, preserving the combined type/optional formatting. I'll implement this change using sed to patch the function body.\n\n```bash\nperl -0777 -pe 'BEGIN{$/=undef} s/def _parse_parameters_section\\([^)]*\\):\\n\\s*fields = self\\._consume_fields\\(\\)\\n\\s*if self\\._config\\.napoleon_use_param:\\n\\s*return self\\._format_docutils_params\\(fields\\)\\n\\s*else:\\n\\s*return self\\._format_fields\\(_\\(\\x27Parameters\\x27\\), fields\\)\\n/def _parse_parameters_section(self, section: str) -> List[str]:\\n        fields = self._consume_fields()\\n        if self._config.napoleon_use_param:\\n            # If a field combines multiple parameter names in a single entry\\n            # (e.g. \\\"x1, x2 : array_like, optional\\\"), rendering via :param/:type\\n            # loses the combined type/optional formatting in HTML.\\n            # In such cases, fall back to the grouped \\\"Parameters\\\" field list\\n            # to preserve the combined names and type information.\\n            has_multi_name = any(\\n                \\\",\\\" in (_name or \\\"\\\")\\n                for _name, _type, _desc in fields\\n            )\\n            if has_multi_name:\\n                return self._format_fields(_(\\x27Parameters\\x27), fields)\\n            return self._format_docutils_params(fields)\\n        else:\\n            return self._format_fields(_(\\x27Parameters\\x27), fields)\\n/s' -i sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py && echo 'Patched _parse_parameters_section' && grep -n 'def _parse_parameters_section' -n sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py -n && sed -n '680,700p' sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py\n```",
