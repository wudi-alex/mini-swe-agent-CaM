Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

I'll patch django/forms/models.py directly using a small Python script: add RadioSelect to the widget import tuple and replace the logic that sets self.empty_label in ModelChoiceField.__init__ with a version that suppresses the empty label when the widget is a RadioSelect (either a class or instance). This single command edits the file in-place.\n\n```bash\npython3 - <<'PY'\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport re\np = Path('django/forms/models.py')\ns = p.read_text()\n\n# Add RadioSelect to the widget import tuple\ns = s.replace(\n    \"HiddenInput, MultipleHiddenInput, SelectMultiple,\\n)\",\n    \"HiddenInput, MultipleHiddenInput, SelectMultiple, RadioSelect,\\n)\"\n)\n\n# Replace the empty_label assignment logic inside ModelChoiceField.__init__\npattern = re.compile(\n    r\"(class ModelChoiceField\\(ChoiceField\\):[\\s\\S]*?def __init__\\([^\\)]*\\):\\n)([\\s\\S]*?)(\\n\\s+# Call Field instead of ChoiceField __init__\\(\\)\\:)\",\n    re.M\n)\nm = pattern.search(s)\nif not m:\n    raise SystemExit(\"Couldn't locate ModelChoiceField.__init__ block\")\npre, body, post = m.group(1), m.group(2), m.group(3)\n\n# Replace the specific if/else that sets self.empty_label\nbody_new = re.sub(\n    r\"\\n\\s*if required and \\(initial is not None\\):\\n\\s*self\\.empty_label = None\\n\\s*else:\\n\\s*self\\.empty_label = empty_label\\n\",\n    \"\\n        # RadioSelect widgets have an inherent unfilled state, so avoid adding\\n        # an extra blank choice for required foreign keys when using radios.\\n        widget_is_radio = False\\n        try:\\n            # widget may be a widget instance or a widget class\\n            widget_is_radio = isinstance(widget, RadioSelect) or (\\n                isinstance(widget, type) and issubclass(widget, RadioSelect)\\n            )\\n        except Exception:\\n            widget_is_radio = False\\n\\n        if widget_is_radio:\\n            # Force no empty label for RadioSelect to prevent a misleading blank option.\\n            self.empty_label = None\\n        elif required and (initial is not None):\\n            self.empty_label = None\\n        else:\\n            self.empty_label = empty_label\\n\",\n    body,\n    count=1\n)\n\ns = s[:m.start()] + pre + body_new + post + s[m.end():]\np.write_text(s)\nprint(\"patched\")\nPY\n```",
