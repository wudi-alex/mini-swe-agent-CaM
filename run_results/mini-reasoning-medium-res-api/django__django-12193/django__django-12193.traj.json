Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2.

Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

      "content": "THOUGHT: The bug is caused by CheckboxInput.get_context mutating the attrs dict passed to it, so subsequent widgets inherit 'checked': True. In SplitArrayWidget.get_context we currently pass the same final_attrs (possibly with an updated id) to each subwidget; if a widget mutates that dict, the mutation persists. To fix this, I will modify the loop to pass a fresh copy of final_attrs to each widget invocation (attrs_i = final_attrs.copy()), updating the id on that copy. This isolates mutations per iteration.
