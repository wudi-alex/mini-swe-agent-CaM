As a result, all copies of the same field share the same dictionary and any modification of either the dictionary or the error message itself for one formfield is immediately reflected on all other formfiels.\nThis is relevant for Forms and ModelForms that modify the error messages of their fields dynamically: while each instance of the specific form (e.g., ProfileForm) is expected to have a set of fields \u201csealed\u201d away from other instances of the same ProfileForm (\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/146086f219d01dbb1cd8c089b5a5667e396e1cc4/django/forms/forms.py#L95), in fact all these instances share the same error messages, resulting in incorrectly raised errors.\nConfirmed for versions of Django going back to 1.11.\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.

I'll perform a targeted replacement of the existing __deepcopy__ method in django/forms/fields.py to deepcopy error_messages (using the memo) so that copies of a Field do not share the same error_messages dict. I'll run a single Python heredoc command to replace the exact function body safely.\n\n```bash\npython3 - <<'PY'\nfrom pathlib import Path\np = Path('django/forms/fields.py')\ntext = p.read_text(encoding='utf-8')\nold = (\n\"    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):\\n\"\n\"        result = copy.copy(self)\\n\"\n\"        memo[id(self)] = result\\n\"\n\"        result.widget = copy.deepcopy(self.widget, memo)\\n\"\n\"        result.validators = self.validators[:]\\n\"\n\"        return result\\n\"\n)\nnew = (\n\"    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):\\n\"\n\"        result = copy.copy(self)\\n\"\n\"        memo[id(self)] = result\\n\"\n\"        result.widget = copy.deepcopy(self.widget, memo)\\n\"\n\"        result.validators = self.validators[:]\\n\"\n\"        # Ensure error_messages is not shared between copies. Use deepcopy so that\\n\"\n\"        # nested structures (or lazy translations) are copied correctly and\\n\"\n\"        # modifications to one field's messages don't affect others.\\n\"\n\"        result.error_messages = copy.deepcopy(getattr(self, 'error_messages', {}), memo)\\n\"\n\"        return result\\n\"\n)\nif old not in text:\n    print('pattern not found, aborting')\n    raise SystemExit(1)\ntext = text.replace(old, new, 1)\np.write_text(text, encoding='utf-8')\nprint('patched')\nPY\n```",
