Analyze the bug issue to directly navigate to the possible bug location by grep commands.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Generate edge test cases to ensure your fix is robust, make sure generate test script only once with complete thinking. \n6.
