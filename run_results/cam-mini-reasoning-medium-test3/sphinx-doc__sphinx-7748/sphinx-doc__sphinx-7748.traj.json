Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'PY' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nPY\n```\n\n### Run python code \n\n```bash\ncd /testbed && python - <<'PY'\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nPY\n```\n\n### Patch and Run Test (Directly combine them into one code block, no need to seperate cmd using &&)\n\n```bash\npython - <<'PY'\n# apply patch\nfrom pathlib import Path\nPath('calculator.py').write_text(\"def add(a, b):\\n    return a + b\\n\")\nprint(\"Applied fix to calculator.py\")\n\n# patch verification\nfrom calculator import add\nresult = add(2, 3)\nassert result == 5, f\"Expected 5, got {result}\"\nprint(f\"Verification passed: 2 + 3 = {result}\")\nPY\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n```bash\nanything\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following message:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis message will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n\n</instructions>",
