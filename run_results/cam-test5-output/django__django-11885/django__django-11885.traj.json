Comments as thinking process start with 'Thoughts'. Keep using concise one or two sentence of reasoning, never use no-information words like 'I need to / I will'.\n1. Stage as decorator representing the stages of APR workflow: @bug_reproduction, @bug_localization, @patch_generation, @patch_verification, @debug\n2. Function name summarizes what you going to do (action) and its intent (for example, generate_and_execute_tests_to_verify_patch). All action information should be expressed by function name.\n3. Function body is tool execution sequence (with no comments inside). Try to compress tool call sequence into one turn to fulfill one action (for example, first save test code then execute it). All tool functions are provided by the next section.\n4. Result should be the necessary input for next turn's action.\n\nCRITICAL STRATEGY: \"Search First, Navigate Later\"\n\nYou must immediately hypothesize the location of the bug based on the Issue Description and use `grep` to pinpoint the exact file and line number when the bug location can be inferred from issue. If you need to understand the structure of codebase first, use 'ls -la'.\n\n## Localization Workflow\n1. **Analyze:** Read the issue to extract key terms (Function names, Class names, Error messages, or unique logic keywords).\n2. **Hypothesize:** If no specific name is given, guess the likely function name (e.g., if the issue is about \"login failure\", guess `login`, `auth`, or `authenticate`).\n3. **Search:** Use `grep -RIn` (or `grep -RInE` for regex) to find definitions or references. **Crucial:** Narrow down your search by specifying file extensions (e.g., `*.py`) and specific directories (e.g., `src/utils`) whenever the context allows.\n4. **Verify:** Only read the specific file content once you have a grep hit.\n\n## Command Best Practices\n- **Standard Search:** `grep -RIn \"Pattern\" .` (Always include line numbers `-n` and ignore binary `-I`).\n- **Filter by File Extension (Highly Recommended):** Use `--include` to avoid noise and save tokens.\n  - Python only: `grep -RIn --include=\"*.py\" \"Pattern\" .`\n  - Java only: `grep -RIn --include=\"*.java\" \"Pattern\" .`\n  - C/C++: `grep -RIn --include=\"*.{c,h,cpp}\" \"Pattern\" .`\n- **Target Specific Directory:** If the issue clearly points to a module (e.g., \"frontend\", \"utils\"), replace `.` with the specific path.\n  - Example: `grep -RIn \"Pattern\" src/utils`\n- **Complex Patterns:** `grep -RInE \"PatternA|PatternB\" .`\n- **Definitions:**\n  - Function: `grep -RIn \"^def function_name\" .`\n  - Class: `grep -RIn \"^class ClassName\" .`\n  - Function Call: `grep -RIn \"^function_name\" .`\n- **Bash Quoting:** Do NOT escape double quotes inside shell commands (e.g., use `grep \"pattern\"`, NOT `grep \\\"pattern\\\"`). Extra backslashes cause `grep: Unmatched ( or \\(` errors.\n\n## Examples of Strategic Searching\n\n### Scenario 1: The issue explicitly names a function in a known language (e.g., \"Integer overflow in `calculate_budget` in the Python backend\")\n**Thought:** IFilter for `.py` files to avoid matching compiled files or logs.\n**Command:** `grep -RIn --include=\"*.py\" \"def calculate_budget\" .`\n\n### Scenario 2: The issue implies a specific module location (e.g., \"The `DateUtils` helper in the utility folder is parsing dates wrong\")\n**Thought:** The issue points to `utils` or a similar folder. Restrict the search to that directory to speed up the process and reduce noise.\n**Command:** `grep -RIn \"class DateUtils\" src/utils`\n\n### Scenario 3: Investigating a symptom in a specific component (e.g., \"Login page raises an error on button click\")\n**Thought:** This is likely a frontend issue or a views issue. Search for \"login\" logic specifically in the `views` or `frontend` directory, and I am looking for Python files.\n**Command:** `grep -RIn --include=\"*.py\" -i \"login\" src/views`\n\n### Scenario 4: Broad search for keywords with file restrictions (e.g., \"JSON serialization fails during export\")\n**Thought:** No function name is given, but \"JSON\" and \"export\" are key. Look for functions that combine these concepts, restricting to `.py` files to filter out noise.\n**Command:** `grep -RInE --include=\"*.py\" \"json.*dump|export|serialize\" .`\n\n### Scenario 5: Tracing a call site in a test file (e.g., \"The test `test_process_payment` is failing\")\n**Thought:** Find the test definition. It is likely in a `tests` directory.\n**Command:** `grep -RIn \"def test_process_payment\" tests/`\n\n**Revert Strategy:** If you need to undo changes or fix a corrupted file, **NEVER** manually patch it back. Use `git checkout <file>` to instantly restore the clean version.\n\n**Example:**\n# Thoughts: The previous patch introduced syntax errors. I will revert the file using git to start fresh.\n@debug\ndef revert_changes():\n    return exec_bash_cmd(\"git checkout sphinx/environment/adapters/toctree.py\")\n\n---\n**ACTION REQUIRED:**\nBased on the current issue description, generate your hypothesis, construct a precise `grep` command (using `--include` and specific paths if possible), and execute it immediately.\n\nTools:\nNotice! ALL PRINT TOOL HAS NO RETURN RESULT AND JUST FOR PRINTING, WHILE CODE PRINTING HAS NO COMMENTS! IF YOU WANT TO SEE CODE WITH COMMENTS, USE BASH CMD TOOL.\n1. print_definition(name_file_list:List[Tuple]): tool used to print the definition code of (name, file_path)s.

      "content": "<pr_description>\nConsider the following PR description:\nCombine fast delete queries\nDescription\n\t\nWhen emulating ON DELETE CASCADE via on_delete=models.CASCADE the deletion.Collector will try to perform fast queries which are DELETE FROM table WHERE table.pk IN .... There's a few conditions required for this fast path to be taken but when this happens the collection logic should combine such queries by table to reduce the number of roundtrips to the database.\nFor example, given the following models\nclass Person(models.Model):\n\tfriends = models.ManyToManyField('self')\nclass User(models.Model):\n\tpass\nclass Entry(models.Model):\n\tcreated_by = models.ForeignKey(User)\n\tupdated_by = models.ForeignKey(User)\nIssuing a person.delete() or user.delete() will result in 3 queries of the form\nDELETE FROM person_friends WHERE from_id = :id\nDELETE FROM person_friends WHERE to_id = :id\nDELETE FROM person WHERE id = :id\nDELETE FROM entry WHERE created_by_id = :id\nDELETE FROM entry WHERE updated_by = :id\nDELETRE FROM user WHERE id = :id\nBut both queries (or N queries depending on the number of foreign relationships) can be combined into a single one by using OR\nDELETE FROM person_friends WHERE from_id = :id OR to_id = :id\nDELETE FROM person WHERE id = :id\nDELETE FROM entry WHERE created_by_id = :id OR updated_by = :id\nDELETE FROM user WHERE id = :id\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting executable codes to fix bugs.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Workflow Must Be Follwed!\n1. Analyze the bug issue to directly navigate to the possible bug location by grep commands.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again; make sure the bug behavior is fixed!\n5. When finish only need to response with \"submit()\"\n\n## Efficiency & Strategy Protocols\n1. **NO Redundant Retrieval:** Before executing `grep` or `print_code`, strictly check your context history. NEVER re-read lines, functions, or files that are already visible in previous turn outputs.\n\n\nExample of a CORRECT response:\n<example_response>\n# Thoughts:\n@bug_reproduction\ndef generate_scrpit_to_reproduce_bug():\n    save_code_to_file(\"bug_script.py\", script)\n    return exec_bash_cmd(\"python3 bug_script.py\")\n</example_response>\n\n\n2. Wait for the first action to complete, see its output, then issue the next action in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full tool stack and Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following message:\n\nsubmit()\n\nThis message will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>",
