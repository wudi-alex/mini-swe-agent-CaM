I tested the change with a small Python snippet (injecting a fake psycopg2.extras to avoid import errors) and observed only the first checkbox had 'checked' in its attrs. I'm done and will submit the changes.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
