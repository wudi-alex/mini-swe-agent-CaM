The core Node\n    18\ttypes are TextNode, VariableNode, IfNode and ForNode, but plugin modules can\n    19\tdefine their own custom node types.\n    20\t\n    21\tEach Node has a render() method, which takes a Context and returns a string of\n    22\tthe rendered node. For example, the render() method of a Variable Node returns\n    23\tthe variable's value as a string. The render() method of a ForNode returns the\n    24\trendered output of whatever was inside the loop, recursively.\n    25\t\n    26\tThe Template class is a convenient wrapper that takes care of template\n    27\tcompilation and rendering.\n    28\t\n    29\tUsage:\n    30\t\n    31\tThe only thing you should ever use directly in this file is the Template class.\n    32\tCreate a compiled template object with a template_string, then call render()\n    33\twith a context. In the compilation stage, the TemplateSyntaxError exception\n    34\twill be raised if the template doesn't have proper syntax.\n    35\t\n    36\tSample code:\n    37\t\n    38\t>>> from django import template\n    39\t>>> s = '<html>{% if test %}<h1>{{ varvalue }}</h1>{% endif %}</html>'\n    40\t>>> t = template.Template(s)\n    41\t\n    42\t(t is now a compiled template, and its render() method can be called multiple\n    43\ttimes with multiple contexts)\n    44\t\n    45\t>>> c = template.Context({'test':True, 'varvalue': 'Hello'})\n    46\t>>> t.render(c)\n    47\t'<html><h1>Hello</h1></html>'\n    48\t>>> c = template.Context({'test':False, 'varvalue': 'Hello'})\n    49\t>>> t.render(c)\n    50\t'<html></html>'\n    51\t\"\"\"\n    52\t\n    53\timport inspect\n    54\timport logging\n    55\timport re\n    56\tfrom enum import Enum\n    57\t\n    58\tfrom django.template.context import BaseContext\n    59\tfrom django.utils.formats import localize\n    60\tfrom django.utils.html import conditional_escape, escape\n    61\tfrom django.utils.regex_helper import _lazy_re_compile\n    62\tfrom django.utils.safestring import SafeData, mark_safe\n    63\tfrom django.utils.text import (\n    64\t    get_text_list, smart_split, unescape_string_literal,\n    65\t)\n    66\tfrom django.utils.timezone import template_localtime\n    67\tfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy, pgettext_lazy\n    68\t\n    69\tfrom .exceptions import TemplateSyntaxError\n    70\t\n    71\t# template syntax constants\n    72\tFILTER_SEPARATOR = '|'\n    73\tFILTER_ARGUMENT_SEPARATOR = ':'\n    74\tVARIABLE_ATTRIBUTE_SEPARATOR = '.'\n    75\tBLOCK_TAG_START = '{%'\n    76\tBLOCK_TAG_END = '%}'\n    77\tVARIABLE_TAG_START = '{{'\n    78\tVARIABLE_TAG_END = '}}'\n    79\tCOMMENT_TAG_START = '{#'\n    80\tCOMMENT_TAG_END = '#}'\n    81\tTRANSLATOR_COMMENT_MARK = 'Translators'\n    82\tSINGLE_BRACE_START = '{'\n    83\tSINGLE_BRACE_END = '}'\n    84\t\n    85\t# what to report as the origin for templates that come from non-loader sources\n    86\t# (e.g. strings)\n    87\tUNKNOWN_SOURCE = '<unknown source>'\n    88\t\n    89\t# match a variable or block tag and capture the entire tag, including start/end\n    90\t# delimiters\n    91\ttag_re = (_lazy_re_compile('(%s.*?%s|%s.*?%s|%s.*?%s)' %\n    92\t          (re.escape(BLOCK_TAG_START), re.escape(BLOCK_TAG_END),\n    93\t           re.escape(VARIABLE_TAG_START), re.escape(VARIABLE_TAG_END),\n    94\t           re.escape(COMMENT_TAG_START), re.escape(COMMENT_TAG_END))))\n    95\t\n    96\tlogger = logging.getLogger('django.template')\n    97\t\n    98\t\n    99\tclass TokenType(Enum):\n   100\t    TEXT = 0\n   101\t    VAR = 1\n   102\t    BLOCK = 2\n   103\t    COMMENT = 3\n   104\t\n   105\t\n   106\tclass VariableDoesNotExist(Exception):\n   107\t\n   108\t    def __init__(self, msg, params=()):\n   109\t        self.msg = msg\n   110\t        self.params = params\n   111\t\n   11\n</output_head>\n<elided_chars>\n3086 characters elided\n</elided_chars>\n<output_tail>\n self.origin,\n   190\t        )\n   191\t\n   192\t        try:\n   193\t            return parser.parse()\n   194\t        except Exception as e:\n   195\t            if self.engine.debug:\n   196\t                e.template_debug = self.get_exception_info(e, e.token)\n   197\t            raise\n   198\t\n   199\t    def get_exception_info(self, exception, token):\n   200\t        \"\"\"\n   201\t        Return a dictionary containing contextual line information of where\n   202\t        the exception occurred in the template.
