Comments as thinking process start with 'Thoughts'. Keep using concise one or two sentence of reasoning, never use no-information words like 'I need to / I will'.\n1. Stage as decorator representing the stages of APR workflow: @bug_reproduction, @bug_localization, @test_generation, @patch_generation, @patch_verification, @debug\n2.

Function body is tool execution sequence (with no comments inside). Try to compress tool call sequence into one turn to fulfill one action (for example, first save test code then execute it). All tool functions are provided by the next section.\n4. Result should be the necessary input for next turn's action.\n\nCRITICAL STRATEGY: \"Search First, Navigate Later\"\n\nYou must immediately hypothesize the location of the bug based on the Issue Description and use `grep` to pinpoint the exact file and line number when the bug location can be inferred from issue. If you need to understand the structure of codebase first, use 'ls -la'.\n\n## Localization Workflow\n1. **Analyze:** Read the issue to extract key terms (Function names, Class names, Error messages, or unique logic keywords).\n2. **Hypothesize:** If no specific name is given, guess the likely function name (e.g., if the issue is about \"login failure\", guess `login`, `auth`, or `authenticate`).\n3. **Search:** Use `grep -RIn` (or `grep -RInE` for regex) to find definitions or references. **Crucial:** Narrow down your search by specifying file extensions (e.g., `*.py`) and specific directories (e.g., `src/utils`) whenever the context allows.\n4. **Verify:** Only read the specific file content once you have a grep hit.\n\n## Command Best Practices\n- **Standard Search:** `grep -RIn \"Pattern\" .` (Always include line numbers `-n` and ignore binary `-I`).\n- **Filter by File Extension (Highly Recommended):** Use `--include` to avoid noise and save tokens.\n  - Python only: `grep -RIn --include=\"*.py\" \"Pattern\" .`\n  - Java only: `grep -RIn --include=\"*.java\" \"Pattern\" .`\n  - C/C++: `grep -RIn --include=\"*.{c,h,cpp}\" \"Pattern\" .`\n- **Target Specific Directory:** If the issue clearly points to a module (e.g., \"frontend\", \"utils\"), replace `.` with the specific path.\n  - Example: `grep -RIn \"Pattern\" src/utils`\n- **Complex Patterns:** `grep -RInE \"PatternA|PatternB\" .`\n- **Definitions:**\n  - Function: `grep -RIn \"^def function_name\" .`\n  - Class: `grep -RIn \"^class ClassName\" .`\n  - Function Call: `grep -RIn \"^function_name(\" .`\n\n## Examples of Strategic Searching\n\n### Scenario 1: The issue explicitly names a function in a known language (e.g., \"Integer overflow in `calculate_budget` in the Python backend\")\n**Thought:** IFilter for `.py` files to avoid matching compiled files or logs.\n**Command:** `grep -RIn --include=\"*.py\" \"def calculate_budget\" .`\n\n### Scenario 2: The issue implies a specific module location (e.g., \"The `DateUtils` helper in the utility folder is parsing dates wrong\")\n**Thought:** The issue points to `utils` or a similar folder. Restrict the search to that directory to speed up the process and reduce noise.\n**Command:** `grep -RIn \"class DateUtils\" src/utils`\n\n### Scenario 3: Investigating a symptom in a specific component (e.g., \"Login page raises an error on button click\")\n**Thought:** This is likely a frontend issue or a views issue. Search for \"login\" logic specifically in the `views` or `frontend` directory, and I am looking for Python files.\n**Command:** `grep -RIn --include=\"*.py\" -i \"login\" src/views`\n\n### Scenario 4: Broad search for keywords with file restrictions (e.g., \"JSON serialization fails during export\")\n**Thought:** No function name is given, but \"JSON\" and \"export\" are key. Look for functions that combine these concepts, restricting to `.py` files to filter out noise.\n**Command:** `grep -RInE --include=\"*.py\" \"json.*dump|export|serialize\" .`\n\n### Scenario 5: Tracing a call site in a test file (e.g., \"The test `test_process_payment` is failing\")\n**Thought:** Find the test definition. It is likely in a `tests` directory.\n**Command:** `grep -RIn \"def test_process_payment\" tests/`\n\n---\n**ACTION REQUIRED:**\nBased on the current issue description, generate your hypothesis, construct a precise `grep` command (using `--include` and specific paths if possible), and execute it immediately.\n\nTools:\nNotice! ALL PRINT TOOL HAS NO RETURN RESULT AND JUST FOR PRINTING, WHILE CODE PRINTING HAS NO COMMENTS!
