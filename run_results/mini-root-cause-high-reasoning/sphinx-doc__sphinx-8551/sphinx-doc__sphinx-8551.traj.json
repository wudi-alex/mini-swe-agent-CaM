Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2.

For unqualified names it seems like they search for the name in every (sub)module instead of in the current module and then parent modules.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n```rst\r\n.. py:class:: mod.A\r\n.. py:class:: mod.submod.A\r\n\r\n.. py:function:: f()\r\n\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.submod.A`\r\n\r\n\t:param mod.A a:\r\n\t:param mod.submod.A b:\r\n\t:rtype: mod.A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.submod.A\r\n\r\n.. py:currentmodule:: mod\r\n\r\n.. py:function:: f()\r\n\r\n\t- :py:class:`A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.submod.A`\r\n\r\n\t:param A a:\r\n\t:param mod.A b:\r\n\t:param mod.submod.A c:\r\n\t:rtype: A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.submod.A\r\n\r\n.. py:currentmodule:: mod.submod\r\n\r\n.. py:function:: f()\r\n\r\n\t- :py:class:`A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.A`\r\n\t- :py:class:`mod.submod.A`\r\n\r\n\t:param A a: BUG: links to mod.A instead of mod.submod.A\r\n\t:param mod.A b:\r\n\t:param mod.submod.A c:\r\n\t:rtype: A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.A\r\n\t:rtype: mod.submod.A\r\n```\r\ngives the warnings\r\n```\r\nindex.rst:28: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\nindex.rst:28: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\nindex.rst:43: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\nindex.rst:43: WARNING: more than one target found for cross-reference 'A': mod.A, mod.submod.A\r\n```\r\nwhich refer to the 4 unqualified type names ``A``.\r\nThe ``:param:`` annotated with ``BUG`` as well as the corresponding ``rtype`` gets resolved to ``mod.A``.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\nNo warnings, and the two mentioned types should resolve to ``mod.submod.A``.\r\n\r\n**Environment info**\r\n- Sphinx version: tested both with v3.3 and with master\n\n\n## Root Cause Analysis Protocol\nYour first objective is to conduct a thorough root cause analysis of the bug.
