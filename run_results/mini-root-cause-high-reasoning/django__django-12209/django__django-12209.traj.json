The behaviour also changes if default=uuid4 is removed from the id field.\nThis seems related to https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29260.\nThe change in behaviour also has the side effect of changing the behaviour of the loaddata management command when the fixture contains explicit pk values and the objects already exist (e.g. when loading the fixture multiple times).\nPerhaps the intention was to only change the behaviour if an explicit pk value was not set on the model instance being saved? (At least, that would be more backwards-compatible behaviour...)\n\n\n## Root Cause Analysis Protocol\nYour first objective is to conduct a thorough root cause analysis of the bug. During this analysis phase, you will have enhanced reasoning capabilities to help you deeply understand the issue.\n\n**IMPORTANT:** Once you have identified the root cause of the bug, you MUST output the following exact phrase in your \"THOUGHT\" output:\n\n**\"I see the issue!\"** \n\nRemember: Thorough understanding now will lead to better fixes later.\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
