For example this doesn't work:\n{% if student.year_in_school == YearInSchool.FRESHMAN %}\nThis is because YearInSchool, being a class, is callable, and Django Templates always call callables with no arguments. The call fails because the required value argument is missing.\nThe easy solution would be to declare do_not_call_in_templates = True on the various Choices classes.\n\n\n## Root Cause Analysis Protocol\nYour first objective is to conduct a thorough root cause analysis of the bug.
