Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1.

Examples would be Python modules, classes, functions etc., elements\n   160\t    of a templating language, Sphinx roles and directives, etc.\n   161\t\n   162\t    Each domain has a separate storage for information about existing objects\n   163\t    and how to reference them in `self.data`, which must be a dictionary.  It\n   164\t    also must implement several functions that expose the object information in\n   165\t    a uniform way to parts of Sphinx that allow the user to reference or search\n   166\t    for objects in a domain-agnostic way.\n   167\t\n   168\t    About `self.data`: since all object and cross-referencing information is\n   169\t    stored on a BuildEnvironment instance, the `domain.data` object is also\n   170\t    stored in the `env.domaindata` dict under the key `domain.name`.
