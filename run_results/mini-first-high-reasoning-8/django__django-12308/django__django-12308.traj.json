Let's search for \"prepare_value\" usage on JSONField across the repo to find clues.\n\n```bash\ngrep -R \"JSONField\" -n django | sed -n '1,400p'\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: The repo search is noisy. I'll open the json-related files in django/db/models/fields to inspect their contents for JSONField class. List the directory again to ensure correct path.\n\n```bash\nls -la django/db/models/fields\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: To find JSONField definition quickly, use Python to import the installed Django module path? But we should search repo files. Let's search for 'json field' strings or 'django.contrib.postgres.fields' references.\n\n```bash\ngrep -R \"contrib.postgres.fields\" -n django || true\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: Another approach: search for \"prepare_value(\" across the django package, then inspect occurrences where JSONField might be referenced.
