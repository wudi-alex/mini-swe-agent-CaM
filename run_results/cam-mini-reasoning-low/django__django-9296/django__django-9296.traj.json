Analyze the bug issue to directly navigate to the possible bug location by grep commands.\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Generate edge test cases to ensure your fix is robust, make sure generate test script only once with complete thinking. \n6. When finish only need to response with \"submit()\"\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent.
