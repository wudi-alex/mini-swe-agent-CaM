Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1.

That's undesirable. I'll fix django/db/models/enums.py by moving any do_not_call_in_templates = True that directly follows a class header to after the class docstring (handling single- and multi-line docstrings). After the change I'll print the file to verify the docstrings and attribute positions.\n\n```bash\npython - <<'PY'\nfrom pathlib import Path\np = Path('django/db/models/enums.py')\ntext = p.read_text()\nlines = text.splitlines(keepends=True)\ni = 0\nout = []\nwhile i < len(lines):\n    line = lines[i]\n    if line.startswith('class ') and i+2 < len(lines):\n        next_line = lines[i+1]\n        next2 = lines[i+2]\n        if next_line.strip() == 'do_not_call_in_templates = True' and next2.lstrip().startswith('\"\"\"'):\n            # Collect docstring lines (handle single- and multi-line docstrings)\n            doc_lines = []\n            j = i + 2\n            # If the starting docstring line contains the closing quotes as well\n            if lines[j].count('\"\"\"') >= 2:\n                doc_lines.append(lines[j])\n                j2 = j\n            else:\n                # Multiline docstring: include lines until we find the closing triple quotes\n                doc_lines.append(lines[j])\n                j2 = j + 1\n                while j2 < len(lines):\n                    doc_lines.append(lines[j2])\n                    if '\"\"\"' in lines[j2]:\n                        break\n                    j2 += 1\n            # Append class header, then docstring, then the attribute, and continue after docstring\n            out.append(line)\n            out.extend(doc_lines)\n            out.append(next_line)\n            i = j2 + 1\n            continue\n    out.append(line)\n    i += 1\np.write_text(''.join(out))\nprint('Updated django/db/models/enums.py')\nPY\n&& nl -ba django/db/models/enums.py | sed -n '1,240p'\n```",
