I verified the behavior by importing the widgets and confirming that use_required_attribute returns False for file inputs when initial data is present. I'll now submit the changes by staging them and showing the cached diff.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
