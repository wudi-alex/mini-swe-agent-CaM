The core Node\n    18\ttypes are TextNode, VariableNode, IfNode and ForNode, but plugin modules can\n    19\tdefine their own custom node types.\n    20\t\n    21\tEach Node has a render() method, which takes a Context and returns a string of\n    22\tthe rendered node. For example, the render() method of a Variable Node returns\n    23\tthe variable's value as a string. The render() method of a ForNode returns the\n    24\trendered output of whatever was inside the loop, recursively.\n    25\t\n    26\tThe Template class is a convenient wrapper that takes care of template\n    27\tcompilation and rendering.\n    28\t\n    29\tUsage:\n    30\t\n    31\tThe only thing you should ever use directly in this file is the Template class.\n    32\tCreate a compiled template object with a template_string, then call render()\n    33\twith a context.
