                "content": "THOUGHT: I updated django/db/models/query.py so bulk_create validates batch_size like bulk_update (raising ValueError for negative sizes) and uses the database-compatible max batch size (via connections[self.db].ops.bulk_batch_size) \u2014 taking min(batch_size, max_batch_size) when a batch_size is provided, and max_batch_size otherwise \u2014 for both inserts with and without PKs. I ran a syntax check to ensure the file compiles. I'll now finalize and submit the changes by staging them and showing the cached diff.\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```",
