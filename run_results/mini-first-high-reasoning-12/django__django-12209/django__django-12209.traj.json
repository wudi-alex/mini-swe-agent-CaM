The behaviour also changes if default=uuid4 is removed from the id field.\nThis seems related to https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29260.\nThe change in behaviour also has the side effect of changing the behaviour of the loaddata management command when the fixture contains explicit pk values and the objects already exist (e.g. when loading the fixture multiple times).\nPerhaps the intention was to only change the behaviour if an explicit pk value was not set on the model instance being saved?

To restore the previous behaviour, only force an insert when the PK was not explicitly set on the instance (i.e., when the default was used to populate it). I'll modify django/db/models/base.py to record whether a PK was present before applying defaults and only force_insert when it wasn't. I'll patch the file in-place with a small Python script to make the change safely.\n\n```bash\npython - <<'PY'\nfrom pathlib import Path\np = Path('django/db/models/base.py')\ns = p.read_text()\nstart_marker = 'pk_val = self._get_pk_val(meta)'\n i = s.find(start_marker)\nif i == -1:\n    print(\"start marker not found\")\nelse:\n    # find the occurrence of 'force_insert = True' after the start marker\n    j = s.find('force_insert = True', i)\n    if j == -1:\n        print(\"end marker not found\")\n    else:\n        # find end of line after force_insert = True\n        k = s.find('\\n', j)\n        if k == -1:\n            k = j + len('force_insert = True')\n        else:\n            k = k + 1\n        old_block = s[i:k]\n        new_block = (\n            \"pk_val = self._get_pk_val(meta)\\n\"\n            \"        # Track whether a primary key value was explicitly set on the instance\\n\"\n            \"        # before applying defaults.\\n\"\n            \"        pk_was_set = pk_val is not None\\n\"\n            \"        if pk_val is None:\\n\"\n            \"            pk_val = meta.pk.get_pk_value_on_save(self)\\n\"\n            \"            setattr(self, meta.pk.attname, pk_val)\\n\"\n            \"        pk_set = pk_val is not None\\n\"\n            \"        if not pk_set and (force_update or update_fields):\\n\"\n            \"            raise ValueError(\\\"Cannot force an update in save() with no primary key.\\\")\\n\"\n            \"        updated = False\\n\"\n            \"        # Skip an UPDATE when adding an instance and primary key has a default,\\n\"\n            \"        # but only if the primary key was not explicitly set on the instance.\\n\"\n            \"        if (\\n\"\n            \"            not force_insert and\\n\"\n            \"            self._state.adding and\\n\"\n            \"            self._meta.pk.default and\\n\"\n            \"            self._meta.pk.default is not NOT_PROVIDED and\\n\"\n            \"            not pk_was_set\\n\"\n            \"        ):\\n\"\n            \"            force_insert = True\\n\"\n        )\n        s2 = s[:i] + new_block + s[k:]\n        p.write_text(s2)\n        print(\"patched\")\nPY\n```",

To do that, I will insert a pk_was_set flag (capturing whether the PK existed before applying defaults) and add \"and not pk_was_set\" to the existing condition that currently forces an insert when the PK has a default. I'll use a short Python script to safely modify the file in-place, avoiding manual sed complexities.\n\n```bash\npython3 - <<'PY'\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport re, sys\np = Path('django/db/models/base.py')\ns = p.read_text()\nif 'pk_was_set' in s:\n    print('already patched')\n    sys.exit(0)\nm = re.search(r'(?m)^(?P<indent>\\s*)pk_val = self._get_pk_val\\(meta\\)\\s*$', s)\nif not m:\n    print('pk_val line not found')\n    sys.exit(1)\ninsert_at = m.end()\nindent = m.group('indent')\ns = s[:insert_at] + '\\n' + indent + 'pk_was_set = pk_val is not None' + s[insert_at:]\nm2 = re.search(r'(?m)^(?P<indent2>\\s*)self\\._meta\\.pk\\.default is not NOT_PROVIDED\\s*$', s)\nif not m2:\n    print('condition line not found')\n    sys.exit(1)\ninsert_at2 = m2.end()\nindent2 = m2.group('indent2')\ns = s[:insert_at2] + '\\n' + indent2 + 'and not pk_was_set' + s[insert_at2:]\np.write_text(s)\nprint('patched')\nPY\n```",

I will run a subset of tests likely to cover model saving behavior: tests for db/models/base.py. I'll run pytest for tests in tests/model which are likely to check save logic. To be safe, I'll run pytest -q for tests/tests/test_models.py or run a few tests.
