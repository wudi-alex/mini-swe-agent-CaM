Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\nCommands must be specified in a single bash code block:\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\nExample of a CORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n</example_response>\n\nExample of an INCORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n\nNow I'll read the file:\n\n```bash\ncat file.txt\n```\n</example_response>\n\nIf you need to run multiple commands, either:\n1. Combine them in one block using && or ||\n```bash\ncommand1 && command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n```\n\n2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n```bash\nanything\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

The core Node\n    18\ttypes are TextNode, VariableNode, IfNode and ForNode, but plugin modules can\n    19\tdefine their own custom node types.\n    20\t\n    21\tEach Node has a render() method, which takes a Context and returns a string of\n    22\tthe rendered node. For example, the render() method of a Variable Node returns\n    23\tthe variable's value as a string. The render() method of a ForNode returns the\n    24\trendered output of whatever was inside the loop, recursively.\n    25\t\n    26\tThe Template class is a convenient wrapper that takes care of template\n    27\tcompilation and rendering.\n    28\t\n    29\tUsage:\n    30\t\n    31\tThe only thing you should ever use directly in this file is the Template class.\n    32\tCreate a compiled template object with a template_string, then call render()\n    33\twith a context. In the compilation stage, the TemplateSyntaxError exception\n    34\twill be raised if the template doesn't have proper syntax.\n    35\t\n    36\tSample code:\n    37\t\n    38\t>>> from django import template\n    39\t>>> s = '<html>{% if test %}<h1>{{ varvalue }}</h1>{% endif %}</html>'\n    40\t>>> t = template.Template(s)\n    41\t\n    42\t(t is now a compiled template, and its render() method can be called multiple\n    43\ttimes with multiple contexts)\n    44\t\n    45\t>>> c = template.Context({'test':True, 'varvalue': 'Hello'})\n    46\t>>> t.render(c)\n    47\t'<html><h1>Hello</h1></html>'\n    48\t>>> c = template.Context({'test':False, 'varvalue': 'Hello'})\n    49\t>>> t.render(c)\n    50\t'<html></html>'\n    51\t\"\"\"\n    52\t\n    53\timport inspect\n    54\timport logging\n    55\timport re\n    56\tfrom enum import Enum\n    57\t\n    58\tfrom django.template.context import BaseContext\n    59\tfrom django.utils.formats import localize\n    60\tfrom django.utils.html import conditional_escape, escape\n    61\tfrom django.utils.regex_helper import _lazy_re_compile\n    62\tfrom django.utils.safestring import SafeData, mark_safe\n    63\tfrom django.utils.text import (\n    64\t    get_text_list, smart_split, unescape_string_literal,\n    65\t)\n    66\tfrom django.utils.timezone import template_localtime\n    67\tfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy, pgettext_lazy\n    68\t\n    69\tfrom .exceptions import TemplateSyntaxError\n    70\t\n    71\t# template syntax constants\n    72\tFILTER_SEPARATOR = '|'\n    73\tFILTER_ARGUMENT_SEPARATOR = ':'\n    74\tVARIABLE_ATTRIBUTE_SEPARATOR = '.'\n    75\tBLOCK_TAG_START = '{%'\n    76\tBLOCK_TAG_END = '%}'\n    77\tVARIABLE_TAG_START = '{{'\n    78\tVARIABLE_TAG_END = '}}'\n    79\tCOMMENT_TAG_START = '{#'\n    80\tCOMMENT_TAG_END = '#}'\n    81\tTRANSLATOR_COMMENT_MARK = 'Translators'\n    82\tSINGLE_BRACE_START = '{'\n    83\tSINGLE_BRACE_END = '}'\n    84\t\n    85\t# what to report as the origin for templates that come from non-loader sources\n    86\t# (e.g. strings)\n    87\tUNKNOWN_SOURCE = '<unknown source>'\n    88\t\n    89\t# match a variable or block tag and capture the entire tag, including start/end\n    90\t# delimiters\n    91\ttag_re = (_lazy_re_compile('(%s.*?%s|%s.*?%s|%s.*?%s)' %\n    92\t          (re.escape(BLOCK_TAG_START), re.escape(BLOCK_TAG_END),\n    93\t           re.escape(VARIABLE_TAG_START), re.escape(VARIABLE_TAG_END),\n    94\t           re.escape(COMMENT_TAG_START), re.escape(COMMENT_TAG_END))))\n    95\t\n    96\tlogger = logging.getLogger('django.template')\n    97\t\n    98\t\n    99\tclass TokenType(Enum):\n   100\t    TEXT = 0\n   101\t    VAR = 1\n   102\t    BLOCK = 2\n   103\t    COMMENT = 3\n   104\t\n   105\t\n   106\tclass VariableDoesNotExist(Exception):\n   107\t\n   108\t    def __init__(self, msg, params=()):\n   109\t        self.msg = msg\n   110\t        self.params = params\n   111\t\n   112\t    def __str__(self):\n   113\t        return self.msg % self.params\n   114\t\n   115\t\n   116\tclass Origin:\n   117\t    def __init__(self, name, template_name=None, loader=None):\n   118\t        self.name = name\n   119\t        self.template_name = template_name\n   120\t        self.loader = loader\n   121\t\n   122\t    def __str__(self):\n   123\t        return self.name\n   124\t\n   125\t    def __eq__(self, other):\n   126\t        return (\n   127\t            isinstance(other, Origin) and\n   128\t            self.name == other.name and\n   129\t            self.loader == other.loader\n   130\t        )\n   131\t\n   132\t    @property\n   133\t    def loader_name(self):\n   134\t        if self.loader:\n   135\t            return '%s.%s' % (\n   136\t                self.loader.__module__, self.loader.__class__.__name__,\n   137\t            )\n   138\t\n   139\t\n   140\tclass Template:\n   141\t    def __init__(self, template_string, origin=None, name=None, engine=None):\n   142\t        #
