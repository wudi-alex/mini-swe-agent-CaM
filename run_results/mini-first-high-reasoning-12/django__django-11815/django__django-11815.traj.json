This causes a problem when using Django translation on the value of the Enum object. \nThe problem is that, when the Enum object value get translated to the users language, the old migration files raise an error stating that the Enum does not have the corresponding value. (because the Enum value is translated to another language)\nExample:\nLet say we have this code in models.py:\nfrom enum import Enum\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\nfrom django.db import models\nclass Status(Enum):\n\tGOOD = _('Good') # 'Good' will be translated\n\tBAD = _('Bad') # 'Bad' will be translated\n\tdef __str__(self):\n\t\treturn self.name\nclass Item(models.Model):\n\tstatus = models.CharField(default=Status.GOOD, max_length=128)\nIn the generated migration file, the code will be:\n...\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status('Good'), max_length=128))\n...\nAfter the translation, 'Good' will be translated to another word and it will not be part of the Status Enum class any more, so the migration file will raise the error on the previous line:\nValueError: 'Good' is not a valid Status\nShouldn't the code generated by the migration uses the name of the Status Enum 'GOOD', not the value of it, since it is changeable?\nIt should be:\n('status', models.CharField(default=Status['GOOD'], max_length=128))\nThis will be correct regardless of the translated word\n\n</pr_description>\n\n<instructions>\n# Task Instructions\n\n## Overview\nYou're a software engineer interacting continuously with a computer by submitting commands.\nYou'll be helping implement necessary changes to meet requirements in the PR description.\nYour task is specifically to make changes to non-test files in the current directory in order to fix the issue described in the PR description in a way that is general and consistent with the codebase.\n\nIMPORTANT: This is an interactive process where you will think and issue ONE command, see its result, then think and issue your next command.\n\nFor each response:\n1.
