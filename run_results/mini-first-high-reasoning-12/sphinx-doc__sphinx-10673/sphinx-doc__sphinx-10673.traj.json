Include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning and what you're trying to accomplish\n2. Provide exactly ONE bash command to execute\n\n## Important Boundaries\n- MODIFY: Regular source code files in /testbed (this is the working directory for all your subsequent commands)\n- DO NOT MODIFY: Tests, configuration files (pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, etc.)\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n1. Analyze the codebase by finding and reading relevant files\n2. Create a script to reproduce the issue\n3. Edit the source code to resolve the issue\n4. Verify your fix works by running your script again\n5. Test edge cases to ensure your fix is robust\n\n## Command Execution Rules\nYou are operating in an environment where\n1. You write a single command\n2. The system executes that command in a subshell\n3. You see the result\n4. You write your next command\n\nEach response should include:\n1. A **THOUGHT** section where you explain your reasoning and plan\n2. A single bash code block with your command\n\nFormat your responses like this:\n\n<format_example>\nTHOUGHT: Here I explain my reasoning process, analysis of the current situation,\nand what I'm trying to accomplish with the command below.\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n</format_example>\n\nCommands must be specified in a single bash code block:\n\n```bash\nyour_command_here\n```\n\n**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Your response SHOULD include a THOUGHT section explaining your reasoning\n- Your response MUST include EXACTLY ONE bash code block\n- This bash block MUST contain EXACTLY ONE command (or a set of commands connected with && or ||)\n- If you include zero or multiple bash blocks, or no command at all, YOUR RESPONSE WILL FAIL\n- Do NOT try to run multiple independent commands in separate blocks in one response\n- Directory or environment variable changes are not persistent. Every action is executed in a new subshell.\n- However, you can prefix any action with `MY_ENV_VAR=MY_VALUE cd /path/to/working/dir && ...` or write/load environment variables from files\n\nExample of a CORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to understand the structure of the repository first. Let me check what files are in the current directory to get a better understanding of the codebase.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n</example_response>\n\nExample of an INCORRECT response:\n<example_response>\nTHOUGHT: I need to examine the codebase and then look at a specific file. I'll run multiple commands to do this.\n\n```bash\nls -la\n```\n\nNow I'll read the file:\n\n```bash\ncat file.txt\n```\n</example_response>\n\nIf you need to run multiple commands, either:\n1. Combine them in one block using && or ||\n```bash\ncommand1 && command2 || echo \"Error occurred\"\n```\n\n2. Wait for the first command to complete, see its output, then issue the next command in your following response.\n\n## Environment Details\n- You have a full Linux shell environment\n- Always use non-interactive flags (-y, -f) for commands\n- Avoid interactive tools like vi, nano, or any that require user input\n- If a command isn't available, you can install it\n\n## Useful Command Examples\n\n### Create a new file:\n```bash\ncat <<'EOF' > newfile.py\nimport numpy as np\nhello = \"world\"\nprint(hello)\nEOF\n```\n\n### Edit files with sed:\n```bash\n# Replace all occurrences\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n\n# Replace only first occurrence\nsed -i 's/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace first occurrence on line 1\nsed -i '1s/old_string/new_string/' filename.py\n\n# Replace all occurrences in lines 1-10\nsed -i '1,10s/old_string/new_string/g' filename.py\n```\n\n### View file content:\n```bash\n# View specific lines with numbers\nnl -ba filename.py | sed -n '10,20p'\n```\n\n### Any other command you want to run\n```bash\nanything\n```\n\n## Submission\nWhen you've completed your work (reading, editing, testing), and cannot make further progress\nissue exactly the following command:\n\n```bash\necho COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT && git add -A && git diff --cached\n```\n\nThis command will submit your work.\nYou cannot continue working (reading, editing, testing) in any way on this task after submitting.\n</instructions>\n",

First I'll print 1-240 then look for the method again.\n\n```bash\nsed -n '1,240p' sphinx/builders/__init__.py\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: I'll search for the get_builder_config definition across the repository to find it and then open its lines. My prior grep located it; I'll print around that area using awk to show relevant lines with numbers.\n\n```bash\nawk 'NR>=620 && NR<=700 {printf \"%5d\\t%s\\n\", NR, $0}' sphinx/builders/__init__.py\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: Since I need to see the get_builder_config implementation and surrounding context precisely, I'll print lines 600-680 to capture the method.\n\n```bash\nnl -ba sphinx/builders/__init__.py | sed -n '600,680p'\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: The previous attempts are not showing the function due to truncation issues. I'll open the file in full but pipe through sed to show the specific function by matching its name.\n\n```bash\nsed -n '1,240p' sphinx/builders/__init__.py | sed -n '600,800p'\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: My attempts to display the function didn't work as expected due to line ranges. I'll open the file and search for the string \"get_builder_config\" with context lines using grep -n -C to show surrounding lines.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n -C3 \"def get_builder_config\" sphinx/builders/__init__.py || true\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: The LOC reported earlier indicates the method exists; I'll search for \"get_builder_config(\" (call sites) to find references and then inspect the class to find the method. I'll print the class definition start and scan for methods around the mid-file. I'll show lines 1-400 to find the class start and then follow from there.\n\n```bash\nnl -ba sphinx/builders/__init__.py | sed -n '1,400p'\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: The previous approach is getting verbose. I can directly open the file with less output by showing the entire file but piping through sed to match the method name and surrounding lines. I'll use awk to print lines that contain 'get_builder_config' and show 10 lines before and after.\n\n```bash\nawk '/get_builder_config/{for(i=NR-10;i<=NR+10;i++) if(i>0) print i\":\",a[i];} {a[NR]=$0}' sphinx/builders/__init__.py\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: That awk command didn\u2019t print expected output due to the way it was structured. I'll use grep -n to find the exact line number and then print a range around it.\n\n```bash\ngrep -n \"get_builder_config\" sphinx/builders/__init__.py && nl -ba sphinx/builders/__init__.py | sed -n '620,660p'\n```\n\nTHOUGHT: The previous approach didn't yield the method contents; but we already saw html builder checks for 'search' and 'genindex' via self.search and get_builder_config('use_index','html'). So to suppress warnings in the toctree adapter, I can add a check when generating the warning: if ref is in ('genindex','modindex','search') and the builder would generate them, skip warning. I need to modify sphinx/environment/adapters/toctree.py at the exception handling that logs the warning (lines ~166-175). I'll open that file around those lines to prepare to edit.\n\n```bash\nnl -ba sphinx/environment/adapters/toctree.py | sed -n '150,180p'\n```",
