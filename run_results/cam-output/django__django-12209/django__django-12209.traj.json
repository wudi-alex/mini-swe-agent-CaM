The behaviour also changes if default=uuid4 is removed from the id field.\nThis seems related to https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/29260.\nThe change in behaviour also has the side effect of changing the behaviour of the loaddata management command when the fixture contains explicit pk values and the objects already exist (e.g. when loading the fixture multiple times).\nPerhaps the intention was to only change the behaviour if an explicit pk value was not set on the model instance being saved?
